    "1. Iris Virginica\n",

    "\n",
    "1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n",

    "\n",
    "3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n",
    "\n",
    "6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]\n",
